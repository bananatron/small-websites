# Contribution Rules

1. **Size must match the overall experience**

The Facebook landing page (although still quite large) doesn't represent the payload of the typical app experience. When sizing pages, a rough aggregate of the overall web experience should be used from a cold cache.


2. **Avoid landing pages for non-web experiences**

The intent of this list is to be a collection of websites/web apps where the primary experience lives on the web. Having a small landing page which promotes a desktop app/game/non-web experience is great, but isn't in the spirit of this list.

3. **Amp/RSS doesn't count**


We'd love to have your help! Feel free to make a PR or open an issue to contribute to this project.
