# Why are small websites important?


### Experience
In 1995 Intel announced the Pentium Pro. It contained 5.5 million transistors and maxed out at a clock speed of 200mhz. Even the dumbest smartphone of today dwarfs this computing power by many orders of magnitude. Video games are now rendering environments with stunning levels of detail and VR is on the doorstep of widespread adoption.

And yet, Gmail takes over 10 seconds to fully load (from a cold cache) on a high speed internet connection with a modern desktop computer (delivering a payload of somewhere between 4 and 10mb). The New York Times takes over 10 seconds and comes in at over 15mb. In general, the average 'page weight' has gone from [500kb in 2011 to 1.9mb in 2019](https://httparchive.org/reports/page-weight), with an even large difference on mobile payloads.

Despite optimizations in browsers and tooling, the web [has become bloated](https://httparchive.org/reports/state-of-the-web#numUrls). Pages freeze, designing empty loading states has become a staple in web design, and javascript tooling is in what feels like a constant state of chaos and flux to maximize developer convenience above all else (including user experience).

**Computers have gotten faster, but the web experiences have not.** 


### Inclusion

Much of the world is not operating with [internet speeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Internet_connection_speeds) or rendering devices that the _modern_ web developer is using to produce (or test) web experience. In addition, many javascript-heavy web experiences dismiss the accessibility standards that come free with built-in browser technologies like HTML and CSS.

**We're leaving half of the world behind.**


### Environment

The internet is [a massive energy consumer](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2015/10/can-the-internet-run-on-renewable-energy.html). As it becomes faster and more integrated into our societies, it will consume more energy. As responsible stewards of the planet, we should make every effort to use energy responsibly.

**Big pages are worse for the planet**



The web is now powering the world - life can't be avoided without it in many parts of the globe. The way we think about crafting the future of the web **can** make the web a better, more inclusive, and more environmentally friendly place.
